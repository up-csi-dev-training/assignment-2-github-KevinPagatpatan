The way I feel right now, I feel like we need to be all alone
So if you just playin' around, you need to tell your girl, "Take your fine ass home, " and that's real
Stop teasin' me, yeah, what? Stop teasin' me
I could change your life so easily
I keep beggin' you to stay, but you're leavin' me
Leavin' me, we got sticks in the club illegally
Got the whole six side, they believe in me
We got members east of the DVP
We got members west on 401
We had a lock on the game, but it's more to come
You gotta pop that ass 'til the morning come
You want shots for the girls? Then order some
